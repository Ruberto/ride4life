              <p class="profile_description" >I'm a very busy mum of triplets!  I've always been involved with charity work.  I helped raise money for Starfish Dinners for Hope, and also gave up working in a corporate to run a small charity called Twenty30, and NGO that partnered groups of professional people who wanted to volunteer with township schools, to work in areas of need within the running of schools.  We struggled to fall pregnant, so when I saw that the ride was in aid of the Genesis Research Trust, which enables incredible research into genetic diseases and infertility, it was a very easy decision to take on the challenge.</p>

              <p class="profile_description">I have spent the past 6 months out of the corporate world to focus my energies on my family, and on our ride4life challenge. Neither Colleen, nor I have ever done mountain biking before, so this is a true challenge of sheer determination. The fact that we both struggled to fall pregnant, makes the challenge even more appealing - if we can raise funds to enable research for the health of women and babies, then it makes sense to do it with all the spirit and gusto we have!</p>

              <p>Despite countless breakthroughs in medical science, we still do not understand why some pregnancies will end in tragedy. For most of us, having a child of our own is the most fulfilling experience of our lives. All of us can imagine the desperation and sadness of parents who lose a baby, and the life-shattering impact that a disabled or seriously ill child has on a family.  The Genesis Research Trust raises money for the largest UK-based collection of scientists and clinicians who are researching the causes and cures for conditions that affect the health of women and babies. This research is available globally.</p>

              <p>Together we can work to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of devastating conditions including miscarriage, premature birth, brain damage, genetic diseases and cancer.</p>

              <h3>Our objectives</h3>
              <p>The objectives of the Trust are to provide financial assistance for medical research and teaching in the field of gynaecology, obstetrics and related fields in paediatrics. The Trust is organised in order to promote, by all available means, the study of healthy childbearing and diseases of women. Our teaching programme is internationally recognised and the work produced has the highest reputation amongst academics and researchers. Our courses and symposia are attended by approximately 3000 full and part-time students per year.</p>

              <h3>Our vision</h3>
              <p>Advances in the wellbeing of women and babies can only be achieved by research into the disorders, which can affect anyone. Our primary aim is to improve the health of the unborn child and its mother.</p>

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>In 1980 Professor Winston began his pioneering work in a small laboratory housed in a portakabin in the grounds of Hammersmith Hospital. He and his team made a number of groundbreaking discoveries relating to the diseases and conditions affecting women and babies including the improvement of technology which resulted in a highly successful IVF service at the Hospital. In 1985, Professor Winston and the team built on the success of the unit and founded the charity, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Trust, which is now Genesis Research Trust. Their vision and objectives were to provide vital support for ground-breaking medical research and the training of scientists to find diagnosis and treatments of devastating conditions affecting women and babies.</p>


              <p>Our successes include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>One of the first screening programmes for cervical cancer</li>
                <li>One of the first pregnancy ultrasound screening programmes</li>
                <li>Early advances into placental physiology * The prevention of premature labour</li>
                <li>Investigation into the genes involved in female cancers and embryo implantation</li>
                <li>The reduction of brain damage in babies born in a vulnerable state</li>
             </ul>

                 <h3>Panama City - La Fortuna Forest Reserve</h3>
                 <p>This morning, after a detailed briefing, we leave early and head to the Panama Canal. This is an incredible spectacle. We drive approximately 6 hours stopping regularly to savour the magnificent history and incredible landscape. Miraflores is one of four great locks that allow ships to pass from the Pacific to the Caribbean. We can watch as vessels - some carrying up to 4000 containers - pass through the lock gates. From the Canal we drive across scenic Panama to the Fortuna Forest Reserve, stopping for lunch en-route. Our journey takes us through rainforest and banana plantations, and finally up into the mountains to the foot of Volcan Baru, an extinct volcano where we reach our camp.</p>

                 <h3>La Fortuna Forest Reserve - Almirante [approx 85km]</h3>
                 <p>After all the excitement it's great to start pedalling! Our start is inspiring, with spectacular views of the Caribbean Sea below us, as we descend through dense primary rainforest: listen out for howler monkeys! The road is steep in places and there could be animals on the road, so be wary! As we descend from the mountains, the humidity and heat will become very noticeable. We reach the small village of Mali and continue towards the coast through forest, passing other small settlements on the way. Once on the coast, we head north along an undulating road where we will catch glimpses of the Bocas del Toro - a collection of small islands and a hide-away of pirates in the past! We continue to our simple camp with a local bar just south of Almirante.</p>

                 <h3>Almirante - Cahuita (Costa Rica) [approx 102km]</h3>
                 <p>Today, we set off early and head towards Costa Rica. Cycling along the coast to Almirante, tackling several hills on the way, we climb to a great look-out spot before heading through a flatter area of banana plantations towards the bustling city of Changuinola. From its rough streets we cycle the final 14km to the border. This is a busy crossing with plenty of activity. We pass through Panama's border controls and walk our bikes across the dishevelled bridge to the Costa Rican immigration. After completion, we continue our ride along a variety of roads, through small busy villages and tropical plantations. The final part of our day takes us along the coast to our hotel on the Caribbean Sea.</p>

                 <p>Today, we enjoy a fairly flat 42km ride along the coast to Lemon. This section is wonderful, with palm trees and beaches along the coast interspersed with villages and dense jungle. We could have a drinks-stop on the beach as we go and may even have time for a quick dip! On the outskirts of Lemon we load up in vehicles and drive through amazing countryside to La Fortuna and the foot of the amazing and smouldering Arenal Volcanoe, where we spend the night in our hotel.</p>

                 <p>After breakfast, we drive for around 1 hour to the start of the day's ride. From San Rafael we head along reasonable tarmac roads through flat cattle country until we arrive at the bustling town of Upala. It is low lying and pretty hot and humid. From here we head towards the small town of Santa Cecilia. The cycling is gentler and we enjoy the scenery around us as we pass through traditional villages and lowland jungle with fantastic trees as we go. The tarmac gives way to a rough dirt road, which is tough cycling but lasts only around 10 kilometres before reaching our camp near the village.</p>

                 <p>We head along the last 10km of rough road to the small town of Santa Cecilia, where we meet tarmac again and continue to the Pan American Highway - an exciting landmark. From here we head along smooth roads north to La Cruz and then onto the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border. We then continue for around 25km to our hotel on the lake-side of Lago Nicaragua. In front of us, Volcans Concepcion and Maderas rise to 1610m and 1394m respectively.</p>

                 <p>Our final ride takes us north along the Pan American Highway, enjoying its smooth road surface and views of the lake and volcanoes. We are heading for wonderful Granada, the most beautiful of Central American cities. Its wonderful churches, museums and squares, combined with its lake-side position, make it a great place to finish and relax in our hotel after the huge achievement of completing this ride.</p>
